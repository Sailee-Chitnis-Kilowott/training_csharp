Three functions are used in "stats.cs":
1 - mean() function 
  Calculated the sum of the array and stored it in variable "sum".
  Then calculate mean by dividing sum with the size of the array and stored the result in variable "resultMean".
  The resultMean will have the required mean.
  
2 - median() function
  Sort the array
  Then check where the size of the array is odd or even
  If the size is even then we get 2 numbers as the middle elements then find the average of both the numbers and stored it in variable "resultMedian"
  else the middle element will be the median and stored it in the variable "resultMedian".
  The resultMedium will have the required median.
  
3 - mode() function
  Take a count,maxCount and maxValue variable and initialise it to zero
  Using for loops compare the elements of the array and if they are equal then increment count variable.
  If the count is greater then maxCount then that array element will be stored in the variable "maxValue".
  That maxValue will be the required mode .
